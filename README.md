## Description

<p>
The volleyball statistics tracking app allows coaches to record and track individual player performance data during volleyball games.
</p>
<p>
The app allows coaches to manually input data such as the number of serves, digs, kills, and blocks made by each player, as well as the number of errors committed.
</p>
<p>
This data is organized and presented in an easy-to-read format, enabling coaches to identify areas where individual players need to improve and make informed decisions about game strategy and player development.
